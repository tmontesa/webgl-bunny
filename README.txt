CMPT 361: Assignment 2 - WebGL Bunny

This application was made in accordance with the steps described. Some notes:
- The lights are initally frozen to show where they are originally located. To enable them, press the required keys (p/s).
- The bunny rotates around the origin/global axes, as requested, and does not rotate on its own axis.
- Z translation was done with up/down arrow keys.

Some information were taken from these sources:

The file, bunny.jpg, contains the bunny image requested. Hope it's shiny enough!

You must use a server to run the application (cannot just open HTML file). Or, you may use this Github link to demo it:
